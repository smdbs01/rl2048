# Reinforcement Learning for 2048 Game with N-Tuple Networks

**WIP**

## Description

This project is a Python implementation of a reinforcement learning agent plays the game of 2048 using N-tuple networks. The training is done using multi-step TD/TC learning.

## Requirements

The project uses _uv_ for package managing. Install _uv_ following the instructions in the official website: [uv installation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

## Usage

After installing _uv_, run the following command to start training:

```bash
uv run main.py
```

See all available options with:

```bash
uv run main.py --help
```

## Results

**TODO**
